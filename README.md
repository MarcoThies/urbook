## Description
With innovative text- and image-generating AIs like Chat GPT or Midjourney, completely new and personalized children's books can be generated, tailored to each individual child. 
Currently, the individual AIs must be operated separately, and the generated content must be manually combined. 
There is high market potential in optimizing this process and offering it as a SaaS or "Children's Book Generation as a Service" on the internet.

In the first step we will develop an MVP for this use case to ensure the basic feasibility. 
The MVP also lays the foundation for demonstrating the potential of such a service to potential customers.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

The software requires a database conenction. 
For this you will need to manually add a file with the name ormconfig.json in the toplevel of the project folder (right in "Team13") and add the following content:

`
{
  "type": "mysql",
  "host": "s204.goserver.host",
  "port": 3306,
  "username": "web14_7",
  "password": "",
  "database": "web14_db7",
  "synchronize": true,
  "entities": [
    "dist/**/*.entity.{js,ts}"
  ]
}
`

The password will be sent seperately upon request.

Further you need to add a file to the same folder called ".env" which contains:

`
SECRETKEY=
PORT=3000
`

The to be added key will be sent seperately upon request as well.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
For support and questions email us at info@urbook.com

## Roadmap
After the MVP we plan to further develop the software into a proper commercial service.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
